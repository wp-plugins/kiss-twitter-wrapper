== Description ==

A simple (no, honestly, it's **stupidly** simple) WordPress wrapper plugin for the Twitter Widgets Configurator (https://twitter.com/settings/widgets/new/user/).

== Installation ==

1. Upload `kiss-twitter-wrapper.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to 'Appearance' -> 'Widget' in WordPress and drag the widget on to your sidebar
4. Follow the instructions and copy and paste the generated code from the Twitter Widgets Configurator in to the `code` field and click save. That's it - you're done!

== Screenshots ==

1. It only takes one line to start using the widget - just copy and paste the generate code from the Twitter widget configurator page and paste it in to the code field.
2. The Twitter Widgets Configurator page shows how easy it is to set up your timeline feed.
